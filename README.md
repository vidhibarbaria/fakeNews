Fake News Detection using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that accurately detects fake news articles. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms, the system can differentiate between real and fake news with over 90% accuracy.

Features
TF-IDF vectorization for text feature extraction

Logistic Regression for classification

Preprocessing pipeline for data cleaning

Custom input testing for user-defined news

Visualizations for data insights and model performance

Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

NLP: TfidfVectorizer

Model: Logistic Regression

Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available corpus of news headlines and articles labeled as fake or real. The data was split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

How It Works
Text data is cleaned (stop words removed, lowercased, etc.)

TF-IDF is applied to convert text into numerical features.

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the features.

The model predicts whether input news is fake or real.

Results
Accuracy: 90%+ on unseen test data

Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Tested on real-world news samples for validation

Demo: Custom News Test
To test your own news headline/article:

python
Copy
Edit
news = ["India to host G20 summit in New Delhi"]
vectorized = tfidf.transform(news)
print(model.predict(vectorized))
Visualizations
The project includes data distribution graphs, word clouds, confusion matrix, and performance charts to provide deeper insight into both the data and the model behavior.

Future Work
Deploying as a web application (Flask/Streamlit)

Improving performance using ensemble models

Adding more diverse datasets for robustness
